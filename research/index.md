Reptiles and amphibians are among the most threatened species on the planet, and an increasing number of their species must be managed in captive breeding programs. Understanding the biodiversity and function of microbes that are present in the digestive tracts of reptiles and amphibians is critical for insight into their role in host health. Early research suggests that the filamentous fungus Basidiobolus is an important member of reptile and amphibian gut microbiomes, and that this fungus influences what types of bacteria are present in the digestive tract. Genomic sequencing of Basidiobolus shows that genes have been transferred to the fungus from the gut bacteria. This transfer of genes between bacteria and fungi results in novel metabolism in the fungus that we propose plays important roles in regulating the reptile/amphibian hostâ€™s immune system, iron metabolism, and chemical communication with the gut bacteria. Below you will find a list of publications resulting from past research in this system.
