We are happy to announce the Herptile Microbiomes Project is getting ready to initiate. The project was notified of successful funding application at the NSF as part of the Rules Of Life Microbiome Interactions and Mechanisms. Our project consists of a team of four researchers from three universities. We are excited to recruit students and postdoctoral researchers into a diverse project that includes field work, live animal experimentation, microbiological methods, molecular methods, genomics, metabolomics, and much more! We also have outreach events planned with Tennessee Zoos and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
