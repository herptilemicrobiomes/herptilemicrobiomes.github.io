The team members attended a workshop at Oregon State University to learn about Metabolomics as lead by Kerrie McPhail and George Neuhaus.

We learned how to prepare samples for metabolite extraction, some theory and practical instruction on the LC-MS works, and analysis of some prepared samples of Basidiobolus grown on different media and under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
